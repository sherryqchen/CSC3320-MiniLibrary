Mini	Library		
Create	a	system	managing	a	mini	library	system.	The	users	include	borrower	and	librarian.	
Each	user	corresponds	to	a	record	(line)	in	a	text	file	named	“UserInfo.txt”.	Each	record	
consists	of	(User	ID,	First	Name,	Last	Name,	Account	Name,	Password,	Role).	The	role	‘B’	
represents	borrower	while	‘L’	represents	librarian.	Assume	users’	information	have	been	
added	to	the	file	“UserInfo.txt”	before	the	execution	of	the	system.		
	
	  	UserInfo.txt	
1,First1	,Last1,	Acct1,1234,B	 		
2,First2	,Last2,	Acct2,	abcd,B	
3,First3	,Last3,	Acct3,	fffff,L	 	
	
	
Every	book	corresponds	to	a	record	(line)	in	a	text	file	named	“mylibrary.txt”.	Each	record	
consists	of	6	fields	(Book	ID,	Title,	Author,	Possession,	Check	out	Date,	Due	Date)	separated	
by	comma:	
Mylibrary.txt	
1,Book1,Author1,Library,null,null	 		 	
2,Book1,Author1,User1,2014-10-22,2014-11-21	
3,Book2,Author2,User1,2014-10-23,2014-11-22	
4,Book3,Author2,User2,2014-10-23,2014-11-22	
5,Book4,Atuhor3,User2,2014-09-22,2014-10-22	
	
l  No	comma	“,”in	title	or	author	name.		
l  This	 mini	 library	 keeps	 the	 record	 for	 each	 book	 in	 the	 library.	 Different	 books	 can	
share	the	book	“Title”.	But	the	“Book	ID”	for	each	book	is	unique.		
l  One	 author	 may	 have	 multiple	 books.	 E.g.	 Both	 book2	 and	 book3	 are	 written	 by	
author1		
l  Possession	 field	 is	 “Library”	 means	 this	 book	 is	 kept	 in	 library,	 such	 as	 book	 #001.	
 Otherwise,	 this	 book	 is	 checked	 out	 by	 the	 corresponding	 user.	 E.g.	 book	 #3	 is	
checked	out	by	User1.		
l  A	user	is	allowed	to	check	out	up	to	3	books.		
l  The	“Checked	out	Date”	field	specifies	the	time	of	the	latest	checked	out	date.	The	loan	
period	for	each	book	is	30	days.	“The	Due	Data”	filed	specifies	the	time	the	book	should	
be	returned.		
l  This	system	asks	the	user	to	login	by	entering	the	correct	account	name	and	password.
